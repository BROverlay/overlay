Ok so... I added a new package, "net-libs/nodejs-bin". Unfortunately, it has
broken permissions, so if you don't know what are you doing, you will remain
with a broken package.

At the moment that i'm writing this, the broken binaries are:

  /usr/bin/corepack -> /usr/lib/node_modules/corepack/dist/corepack.js
  /usr/bin/npm -> /usr/lib/node_modules/npm/bin/npm-cli.js*
  /usr/bin/npx -> /usr/lib/node_modules/npm/bin/npx-cli.js


So, if you want it working, you should `chmod 755` on the files above.
